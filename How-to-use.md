How to use PLERC?

# Basic 

PLERC is very simple to use. Just type your source and destination postal addresses in the given text inputs. You can then press the search button to start your search. After a (small) waiting time, your path is displayed with travel statistics on the right.

> Note that you **MUST** provide the town you want to focus on. Check the *Options* section to learn how to do so.

# Options

PLERC provides a small set of options to help you :

* *Algorithme*: allows you to choose between various implementation of pathfinding algorithm. Small tip: Dijkstra should be faster, but simplexes are our own implementations !
* *Trafic*: trafic is only available with our simplexes. It generates a random trafic on the town you are focusing on. Note that it is ***WAY LONGER*** than a simple pathfinding.
* *Ville*: allows you to choose on which city you want to search your path.
